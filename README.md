LucyBounty – Project Overview
🌟 Project Name Meaning

The name LucyBounty draws inspiration from Lucy (Dinkinesh), the iconic fossil unearthed in Ethiopia — a symbol of discovery and rich heritage. Paired with Bounty, which represents rewards given to ethical hackers for uncovering vulnerabilities, LucyBounty stands as Ethiopia’s very own platform dedicated to discovering and securing digital frontiers while uplifting local talent.
